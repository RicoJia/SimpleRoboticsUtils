# Simple Robotics Cpp Utils

- This is a static cpp libary: despite increased binary size and compile time, static is great for version deployment. Please note, it's **C++20 compatible**
- It has a gtest framework, see how things are set up there.

## Usage

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j7 
```
